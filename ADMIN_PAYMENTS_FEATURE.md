## üìä Database Schema

The payments table structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.payments (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    booking_id uuid REFERENCES public.bookings(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    provider text DEFAULT 'paystack',
    reference text UNIQUE,
    status text DEFAULT 'pending',
    amount decimal(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    currency text DEFAULT 'ZAR',
    paid_at timestamptz,
    created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

## üîê Security & Access Control

### RLS Policies
The following policies ensure proper access:

1. **Admin Access:**
   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all payments"
     ON public.payments FOR SELECT
     USING (
       EXISTS (
         SELECT 1 FROM public.profiles
         WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid()
         AND profiles.role = 'admin'
       )
     );
   ```

2. **User Access:** Users can only view their own payments
3. **Service Role:** Edge functions can manage payments
