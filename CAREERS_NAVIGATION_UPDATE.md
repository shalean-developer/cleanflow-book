## 📝 Optional Enhancement: Add to Header Navigation

If you want to add "Careers" to the main header navigation, update `src/components/Header.tsx`:

```tsx
const defaultNavItems: NavItem[] = [
  { to: '/', label: 'Home', icon: Home },
  { to: '/services', label: 'Services', icon: Sparkles },
  { to: '/how-it-works', label: 'How It Works', icon: ShieldCheck },
  { to: '/locations', label: 'Locations', icon: BadgeDollarSign },
