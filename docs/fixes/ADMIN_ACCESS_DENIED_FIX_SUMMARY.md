# Admin Access Denied Fix Summary

## Problem Description
When logging in with the admin account (`admin@shalean.com`) and trying to access the admin dashboard, users were getting an "Access Denied" error with the message "You don't have permission to access this page."

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was identified in the debug information showing:
- **User ID**: `2e986463-3b9a-49f9-ba87-846aae33260e`
- **User Email**: `admin@shalean.com`
- **Is Admin**: `No` ❌
- **Is Cleaner**: `No`
- **Profile Role**: `No role in profile`

The problem was that the admin user didn't have the proper role assignment in the database, specifically in the `user_roles` table.

## Technical Details

### How Admin Role Checking Works
1. The `useAuth` hook in `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx` fetches user roles from two sources:
   - Primary: `user_roles` table (newer system)
   - Fallback: `profiles.role` column (backward compatibility)

2. The AdminDashboard component checks `isAdmin` from the useAuth hook
3. If `isAdmin` is false, it shows "Access Denied" and redirects to home

### Database Structure
- `user_roles` table: Contains user role assignments with `app_role` enum type
- `profiles` table: Contains user profile information with optional `role` column
- Both tables have Row Level Security (RLS) policies

## Solution

### Step 1: Execute the Fix Script
Run the `fix_admin_role_assignment.sql` script in your Supabase SQL Editor. This script:

1. **Checks current state** of the admin user
2. **Ensures proper table structure** exists
3. **Creates/updates admin profile** in the `profiles` table
4. **Creates/updates admin role** in the `user_roles` table
5. **Sets up proper RLS policies** for both tables
6. **Verifies the fix** worked correctly

### Step 2: Test the Fix
After running the SQL script:

1. **Refresh your browser** to reload the authentication state
2. **Log out and log back in** with `admin@shalean.com`
3. **Navigate to the dashboard** from the account dropdown
4. **Verify admin access** - you should now see the admin dashboard instead of "Access Denied"

### Step 3: Optional Browser Testing
Run the `test_admin_fix.js` script in your browser console to verify the database changes:

```javascript
// Copy and paste the contents of test_admin_fix.js into browser console
// This will test the database queries and show you the results
```

## Expected Results After Fix

### Before Fix:
- **Is Admin**: `No`
- **Profile Role**: `No role in profile`
- **Access**: ❌ Access Denied

### After Fix:
- **Is Admin**: `Yes` ✅
- **Profile Role**: `admin` ✅
- **Access**: ✅ Admin Dashboard loads successfully

## Files Modified
- `fix_admin_role_assignment.sql` - Database fix script
- `test_admin_fix.js` - Browser testing script
- `ADMIN_ACCESS_DENIED_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Database Tables Affected
- `user_roles` - Added admin role for admin@shalean.com
- `profiles` - Updated profile role for admin@shalean.com
- RLS policies - Ensured proper access permissions

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Always ensure new admin users are properly added to both `profiles` and `user_roles` tables
2. Use the `has_role()` function for consistent role checking
3. Test admin access after any database migrations or user creation

## Troubleshooting
If the issue persists after running the fix:
1. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Verify the SQL script ran without errors
3. Check Supabase logs for any database errors
4. Ensure you're logged in with the correct admin email
5. Try logging out and logging back in to refresh the auth state
