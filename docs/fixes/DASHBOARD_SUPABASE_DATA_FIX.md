# Dashboard Supabase Data Fix

## Overview

This fix ensures that all dashboard pages reliably fetch data from **Supabase** (not Lovable), with proper role-based access (admin/cleaner/user), pagination support, and reliable refresh behavior that never hangs.

## Branch

`fix/dashboard-supabase-data`

## Changes Made

### 1. New Files Created

#### `src/lib/dataClient.ts`
- **Purpose**: Reusable pagination and query utilities for Supabase
- **Key Functions**:
  - `sbPage<T>()`: Cursor-based pagination with configurable filters, ordering, and limits
  - `sbSingle<T>()`: Fetch single record by ID
  - `sbAll<T>()`: Fetch all records matching filters (use with caution on large tables)
- **Features**:
  - Cursor-based pagination (forward/backward)
  - Flexible equality filters
  - Custom ordering (ascending/descending)
  - Type-safe with TypeScript generics

#### `src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts`
- **Purpose**: Custom React hooks for dashboard data fetching with role-based filtering
- **Hooks Provided**:
  - `useBookingsPage(pageSize)`: Paginated bookings based on user role
    - Admins: See all bookings with relations
    - Cleaners: See assigned bookings (by cleaner_id)
    - Users: See their own bookings (by user_id)
  - `useDashboardStats()`: Booking statistics (total, pending, scheduled, completed, cancelled)
  - `usePaymentStats()`: Payment statistics (admin only)
  - `useCleanerStats()`: Cleaner statistics (admin only)
  - `useApplicationStats()`: Application statistics (admin only)
- **Features**:
  - Automatic role-based filtering
  - Non-blocking loading states
  - Error handling
  - Refresh capability
  - Cancellation support (prevents memory leaks)

### 2. Updated Files

#### `src/pages/dashboard/AdminDashboard.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced manual data fetching with new hooks
  - Split data loading into bookings (via hooks) and additional data (cleaners, applications, payments)
  - Updated stats display to use data from multiple specialized hooks
  - Maintains existing UI and functionality
  - Better separation of concerns

#### `src/pages/dashboard/CustomerDashboard.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced manual booking fetch with `useBookingsPage` hook
  - Added `useDashboardStats` for statistics
  - Removed redundant `fetchBookings` function
  - Simplified loading state management
  - Data automatically filtered for current user

#### `src/pages/dashboard/CleanerDashboard.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced bookings fetch with `useBookingsPage` hook
  - Split loading into profile loading and bookings loading
  - Bookings automatically filtered by cleaner_id
  - Maintains cleaner profile separate fetch (specific to cleaners table)
  - Improved data refresh callback

## Key Features

### 1. Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin**: Sees all data across the system
- **Cleaner**: Sees only bookings assigned to them (via cleaner_id)
- **User**: Sees only their own bookings (via user_id)

### 2. Non-Blocking Loading
- All hooks use cancellation tokens to prevent state updates after unmount
- Loading states never hang, even on page refresh
- Separate loading states for different data types

### 3. Automatic Data Filtering
- Hooks automatically apply role-based filters
- No manual role checking in components
- Consistent filtering logic across all dashboards

### 4. Error Handling
- Graceful error handling with fallback states
- Console logging for debugging
- Toast notifications for user-facing errors

### 5. Refresh Support
- All hooks provide refresh callbacks
- Can trigger data reload without full page refresh
- Maintains cursor position for pagination

## Database Structure

The hooks assume the following Supabase tables:

### `bookings`
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- user_id (uuid, references auth.users)
- cleaner_id (uuid, references cleaners.id, nullable)
- status (text: 'pending' | 'scheduled' | 'completed' | 'cancelled')
- service_name (text)
- created_at (timestamptz)
- date (date)
- ... other fields
```

### `cleaners`
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- user_id (uuid, references auth.users)
- name (text)
- available (boolean)
- rating (numeric, nullable)
- service_areas (text[])
- ... other fields
```

### `payments`
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- booking_id (uuid, references bookings.id)
- amount (numeric)
- status (text: 'pending' | 'success' | 'failed')
- ... other fields
```

### `cleaner_applications`
```sql
- id (uuid, primary key)
- status (text: 'pending' | 'new' | 'approved' | 'rejected')
- ... other fields
```

## Testing Checklist

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have test users with different roles:
   - Admin user (role: 'admin' in profiles table)
   - Cleaner user (role: 'cleaner' in profiles table, with cleaner record)
   - Regular user (role: 'customer' or default)
2. Ensure you have sample data in the database:
   - Multiple bookings with different statuses
   - Bookings assigned to different users and cleaners
   - Payments linked to bookings
   - Cleaner applications with various statuses

### Test Cases

#### 1. Admin Dashboard (`/dashboard/admin`)
- [ ] Login as admin
- [ ] Verify dashboard loads without hanging
- [ ] Check that all booking stats are displayed correctly:
  - [ ] Total Bookings
  - [ ] Pending Bookings
  - [ ] Scheduled Bookings
  - [ ] Completed Bookings
- [ ] Check payment stats:
  - [ ] Total Payments
  - [ ] Successful Payments
  - [ ] Total Revenue (in ZAR)
- [ ] Check cleaner stats:
  - [ ] Total Cleaners
  - [ ] Active Cleaners
- [ ] Check application stats:
  - [ ] Total Applications
  - [ ] Pending Applications
- [ ] Verify bookings table shows all bookings (not filtered)
- [ ] Refresh the page and ensure data reloads correctly
- [ ] Check browser network tab: should only see Supabase endpoints

#### 2. Customer Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- [ ] Login as regular user (customer)
- [ ] Verify dashboard loads without hanging
- [ ] Check stats display:
  - [ ] Upcoming Bookings count
  - [ ] Total Bookings count
- [ ] Verify only customer's own bookings are shown
- [ ] Check "Upcoming" tab shows future bookings only
- [ ] Check "Past" tab shows completed/past bookings
- [ ] Refresh the page and ensure data persists correctly
- [ ] Check network tab: only Supabase, no Lovable endpoints

#### 3. Cleaner Dashboard (`/dashboard/cleaner`)
- [ ] Login as cleaner user
- [ ] Verify dashboard loads without hanging
- [ ] Check stats display:
  - [ ] Today's Jobs
  - [ ] Upcoming Jobs
  - [ ] Completed Jobs
  - [ ] Rating
- [ ] Verify only bookings assigned to this cleaner are shown
- [ ] Check "Today" tab shows jobs scheduled for today
- [ ] Check "Upcoming" tab shows future assigned jobs
- [ ] Check "Completed" tab shows completed jobs
- [ ] Verify cleaner profile information is displayed correctly
- [ ] Refresh the page and ensure data reloads correctly
- [ ] Check network tab: only Supabase endpoints

#### 4. Data Consistency
- [ ] Create a new booking as customer → verify it appears in customer dashboard
- [ ] Assign the booking to a cleaner (as admin) → verify it appears in cleaner dashboard
- [ ] Update booking status → verify stats update in relevant dashboards
- [ ] Complete a booking → verify counts update correctly

#### 5. Performance & Reliability
- [ ] Refresh each dashboard multiple times in quick succession
- [ ] Verify no hanging or infinite loading states
- [ ] Check console for errors or warnings
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks (use browser dev tools)
- [ ] Test with slow network (throttling in dev tools)

#### 6. Error Handling
- [ ] Test with no bookings in database
- [ ] Test with invalid user role
- [ ] Test with network disconnected
- [ ] Verify appropriate error messages are shown

### Network Verification
Open browser DevTools → Network tab and ensure:
- ✅ All requests go to your Supabase URL
- ✅ No requests to `*.lovable.dev` or other external services
- ✅ Requests use proper authentication headers
- ✅ RLS policies are being enforced (check returned data)

## Migration from Old Code

### Before (Example from AdminDashboard)
```tsx
const [bookings, setBookings] = useState([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [stats, setStats] = useState({ totalBookings: 0, ... });

useEffect(() => {
  fetchAllData();
}, [user]);

const fetchAllData = async () => {
  const { data: bookingsData } = await supabase.from('bookings').select('*');
  setBookings(bookingsData || []);
  setStats({ totalBookings: bookingsData?.length || 0, ... });
  setLoading(false);
};
```

### After
```tsx
const { rows: bookings, loading: bookingsLoading } = useBookingsPage(50);
const { stats: bookingStats, loading: statsLoading } = useDashboardStats();
const loading = authLoading || bookingsLoading || statsLoading;

// No manual fetching needed - hooks handle it automatically
```

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Never hangs on refresh, proper loading states
2. **Maintainability**: Centralized data fetching logic
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with generics
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Data logic separated from UI
5. **Reusability**: Hooks can be used in any component
6. **Performance**: Automatic cancellation prevents memory leaks
7. **Role-Based Security**: Automatic filtering based on user role
8. **Testability**: Hooks can be tested independently

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Pagination**: Currently loads 50 items at once; can add load-more functionality
2. **Real-time Updates**: Add Supabase subscriptions for live data
3. **Caching**: Add SWR or React Query for better caching
4. **Optimistic Updates**: Update UI before server confirms
5. **Search/Filter**: Add client-side or server-side filtering
6. **Sorting**: Add custom sorting capabilities

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard shows no data
- Check that RLS policies allow the user to read their data
- Verify the user has the correct role in the `profiles` table
- Check browser console for errors

### Stats show 0 despite having data
- Verify the stats hooks are not throwing errors (check console)
- Ensure the user role is correctly set
- Check that the queries in `useDashboardData.ts` match your schema

### Cleaner dashboard shows no bookings
- Verify the cleaner has a record in the `cleaners` table
- Check that bookings have the correct `cleaner_id`
- Ensure the `user_id` in cleaners table matches the logged-in user

### Data doesn't refresh
- Check if the refresh callback is being called
- Verify the hooks are properly cancelling previous requests
- Look for errors in the network tab

## SQL Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify data:

```sql
-- Check user roles
SELECT id, email, raw_user_meta_data->>'role' as role FROM auth.users;

-- Check if profiles exist
SELECT * FROM profiles ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check bookings with relations
SELECT 
  b.id, 
  b.user_id, 
  b.cleaner_id, 
  b.status,
  u.email as user_email
FROM bookings b
LEFT JOIN auth.users u ON b.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY b.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check cleaners
SELECT 
  c.id, 
  c.user_id, 
  c.name,
  u.email as user_email
FROM cleaners c
LEFT JOIN auth.users u ON c.user_id = u.id;

-- Count bookings by status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM bookings GROUP BY status;
```

## Deployment Notes

1. Ensure all environment variables are set in production:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

2. Verify RLS policies are enabled and correct

3. Test with production data before full rollout

4. Monitor error logs for any issues

5. Consider adding analytics to track loading times
