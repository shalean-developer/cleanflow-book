# Map Preview Implementation

## Overview
The map preview feature has been successfully implemented in the booking Schedule page. Users can now see a live map preview when they enter their service address.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Map Component (`src/components/ui/map-preview.tsx`)
- **Interactive Map**: Uses Leaflet with OpenStreetMap tiles
- **Geocoding**: Converts addresses to coordinates using Nominatim (free service)
- **Loading States**: Shows loading spinner while geocoding
- **Error Handling**: Displays user-friendly error messages
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Debounced Input**: Waits 500ms after user stops typing before geocoding

### ✅ Integration
- **Schedule Page**: Map preview appears in the Location section
- **Real-time Updates**: Map updates as user types address
- **South Africa Focus**: Geocoding optimized for South African addresses

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
```bash
npm install leaflet react-leaflet@4.2.1 @types/leaflet
```

### Key Components
1. **MapPreview Component**: Main map component with geocoding
2. **Leaflet Integration**: Lightweight mapping library
3. **Nominatim Geocoding**: Free OpenStreetMap geocoding service

### Map Features
- **Zoom Level**: 15 (good for street-level view)
- **Marker**: Custom marker showing service location
- **Popup**: Shows address when marker is clicked
- **Tiles**: OpenStreetMap tiles (free, no API key required)

## Usage

### In Schedule Page
```tsx
<MapPreview address={location} />
```

### Props
- `address: string` - The address to display on the map
- `className?: string` - Optional CSS classes

## States Handled

1. **Empty Address**: Shows placeholder with "Enter address to see map"
2. **Loading**: Shows spinner with "Finding location..."
3. **Error**: Shows error message if address not found or geocoding fails
4. **Success**: Shows interactive map with marker at location

## Benefits

- **No API Keys Required**: Uses free OpenStreetMap services
- **Fast Performance**: Lightweight Leaflet library
- **User Experience**: Real-time visual feedback
- **Cost Effective**: No monthly fees or usage limits
- **Reliable**: OpenStreetMap has excellent South African coverage

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Address autocomplete/suggestions
- Multiple marker support
- Custom map styling
- Distance calculation from service areas
- Integration with Google Maps (if API key available)

## Testing

The implementation has been tested for:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Component integration
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Loading states

The map preview is now fully functional and ready for use!
