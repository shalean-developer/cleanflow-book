# Booking Creation Fix - Quick Summary

## What Was Fixed
âœ… Bookings are now created in the database after successful payment

## Problem
- Users completed payment successfully
- BUT bookings were never saved to database
- Confirmation page had to use mock data

## Solution
Updated `src/pages/booking/Review.tsx` to:
1. Call `verify-paystack-payment` Edge Function after payment
2. Wait for booking to be created
3. Only then redirect to confirmation page

## Files Changed
1. **src/pages/booking/Review.tsx** (lines 135-181)
   - Added async payment verification
   - Added booking creation
   - Added error handling

2. **src/pages/booking/Confirmation.tsx** (lines 47-73)
   - Removed mock booking fallback
   - Added retry logic
   - Improved error messages

## Testing
After deploying, test this flow:
1. Create a booking
2. Complete payment
3. **Verify booking exists in database:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM bookings 
   WHERE payment_reference = 'BK-...' 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```
4. Check confirmation page displays correctly
5. Verify booking appears in user's dashboard

## Critical: Edge Function Must Be Deployed
The `verify-paystack-payment` Edge Function **MUST** be deployed to Supabase:
```bash
supabase functions deploy verify-paystack-payment
```

## Quick Health Check
```sql
-- Should return 0 (no successful payments without bookings)
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM payments p
WHERE p.status = 'success'
  AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM bookings b 
    WHERE b.payment_reference = p.reference
  );
```

## If Something Goes Wrong
1. Check Supabase Edge Function logs
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify user is authenticated
5. Contact support with payment reference

## Environment Variables Required
```
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
SUPABASE_URL=https://...
