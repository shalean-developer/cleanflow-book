```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration

Run the migration to create the table and storage bucket:

```bash
# Option A: Using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Option B: Manual (in Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor)
# Copy and run the contents of:
# supabase/migrations/20251011120000_create_cleaner_applications.sql
```

### 2. Storage Bucket Setup

Verify the bucket was created:
- Go to Supabase Dashboard > Storage
- Check for `applications` bucket
- Verify policies are active:
  - ‚úÖ Anyone can upload
  - ‚úÖ Authenticated users can read

### 3. Deploy Edge Function

```bash
# Deploy the email notification function
supabase functions deploy send-application-confirmation
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Supabase Dashboard > Edge Functions > Configuration:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGc...
```

### 5. Build & Deploy Frontend

```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Preview build
npm run preview

# Deploy to your hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
# Example for Vercel:
vercel --prod
```

## üé® Brand Consistency

All styling follows the Shalean brand guidelines:
- Primary: `#0C53ED`

- Border radius: `rounded-2xl` (cards), `rounded-xl` (inputs)

## üìä Admin Dashboard (Future)

To build an admin dashboard at `/admin/applications`:

1. Create protected route with authentication
2. Query applications:
```typescript
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('cleaner_applications')
  .select('*')
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
```
3. Display in table with filters (status, date range)
4. Allow status updates
5. Add notes field
6. Export to CSV functionality

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Emails not sending
- Check RESEND_API_KEY in edge function secrets
- Verify `bookings@shalean.co.za` is a verified domain in Resend
- Check edge function logs: `supabase functions logs send-application-confirmation`

### File uploads failing
- Verify storage bucket exists and is named `applications`
- Check storage policies are active
- Ensure file sizes are under 5MB
- Verify MIME types are allowed

### Form not submitting
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase client is initialized
- Test Supabase connection
- Check RLS policies allow INSERT

### TypeScript errors
- Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are up to date
- The types file has been updated with `cleaner_applications`
- Restart TypeScript server if needed

## üìà Analytics & Monitoring

Consider adding:

1. **Application Metrics**
   - Total applications received
   - Conversion rate (views ‚Üí submissions)
   - Average completion time
   - Drop-off points

2. **Success Rate**
   - Email delivery rate
   - File upload success rate
   - Database insertion success rate

3. **User Feedback**
   - Form usability survey
   - Time to complete
   - Error frequency

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Review new applications daily
- Update status in database
- Respond within 3-5 business days (as promised)
- Archive old applications (>6 months)

### Periodic Updates
- Update areas list (if service regions expand)
- Update skills list (if new services added)
- Update requirements (if criteria change)
- Review and update email templates
