# Authentication Fix Test Verification

## Changes Summary

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ **Race condition in useAuth hook** - Now properly waits for session and profile to load before setting `loading = false`
2. ✅ **Missing Supabase config** - Added `detectSessionInUrl: true` and `flowType: 'pkce'`
3. ✅ **Dashboard premature role checks** - Admin and Cleaner dashboards now wait for `authLoading` to complete
4. ✅ **Session persistence** - Proper session management across page refreshes

## Test Instructions

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### 1. Login Flow Test
- [ ] Open the application at `http://localhost:5173`
- [ ] Click "Login" and enter valid credentials
- [ ] Verify: Dashboard loads within 1-2 seconds
- [ ] Verify: "Auth Loading: Yes" changes to "Auth Loading: No"
- [ ] Verify: Correct role is detected (Is Admin: Yes/No)
- [ ] Verify: Profile Role shows correct role
- [ ] Verify: No "Access Denied" errors for valid users

#### 2. Page Refresh Test
- [ ] While logged in, press F5 to refresh the page
- [ ] Verify: User stays logged in
- [ ] Verify: Dashboard loads correctly
- [ ] Verify: "Auth Loading: Yes" disappears within 1-2 seconds
- [ ] Verify: Role persists (Is Admin/Is Cleaner status unchanged)
- [ ] Verify: No infinite loading screen

#### 3. Session Persistence Test
- [ ] Log in to the application
- [ ] Close the browser completely
- [ ] Reopen browser and navigate to the site
- [ ] Verify: User is still logged in
- [ ] Verify: Session restored automatically
- [ ] Verify: No need to log in again

#### 4. Role-Based Access Test

**As Admin:**
- [ ] Log in with admin credentials
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard/admin`
- [ ] Verify: Access granted (no "Access Denied" message)
- [ ] Verify: Admin dashboard loads with all data
- [ ] Verify: "Is Admin: Yes" shows in debug info

**As Customer:**
- [ ] Log in with customer credentials
- [ ] Try to navigate to `/dashboard/admin`
- [ ] Verify: Redirected to home or customer dashboard
- [ ] Verify: "Access Denied" message appears

**As Cleaner:**
- [ ] Log in with cleaner credentials
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard/cleaner`
- [ ] Verify: Access granted
- [ ] Verify: Cleaner dashboard loads with jobs

#### 5. Logout Test
- [ ] While logged in, click "Sign Out"
- [ ] Verify: Redirected to home page
- [ ] Verify: Session cleared
- [ ] Try to navigate to `/dashboard`
- [ ] Verify: Cannot access (redirected or blocked)

#### 6. Auth State Change Test
- [ ] Log in with one account
- [ ] Open browser console (F12)
- [ ] Check for "Auth state changed:" logs
- [ ] Verify: No errors in console
- [ ] Verify: State changes logged properly

### Debug Information to Monitor

During loading screens, you should see:
```
Debug Info:
- Auth Loading: Yes → should change to No within 1-2s
- User ID: [UUID] → should show valid user ID
- User Email: [email] → should show user's email
- Is Admin: Yes/No → should reflect actual role
- Profile Role: admin/cleaner/customer → should match user role
- Component Loading: Yes → should change to No after data loads
```

### Expected Behavior

✅ **Normal Flow:**
1. User logs in
2. "Auth Loading: Yes" for ~1 second
3. "Auth Loading: No" appears
4. Profile role loads
5. Dashboard renders with data
6. Total time: 1-3 seconds

❌ **Bug (Should NOT happen):**
1. User logs in
2. "Auth Loading: Yes" forever
3. Role never detected
4. Stuck on loading screen
5. Need to clear cookies

## Automated Test Script

You can also run this Node.js script to test the auth flow programmatically:

```javascript
// test_auth_flow.js
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');

const supabaseUrl = process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseKey = process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY;

const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey, {
  auth: {
    persistSession: true,
    autoRefreshToken: true,
    detectSessionInUrl: true,
    flowType: 'pkce',
  }
});

async function testAuthFlow() {
  console.log('Testing authentication flow...');
  
  // Test 1: Get session
  const { data: sessionData, error: sessionError } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
  if (sessionError) {
    console.error('❌ Session error:', sessionError);
  } else {
    console.log('✅ Session retrieved:', !!sessionData.session);
  }
  
  // Test 2: Listen for auth changes
  const { data: { subscription } } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((event, session) => {
    console.log('✅ Auth state changed:', event, !!session);
  });
  
  console.log('✅ Auth listener setup complete');
  
  // Cleanup
  setTimeout(() => {
    subscription.unsubscribe();
    console.log('✅ Test complete');
  }, 5000);
}

testAuthFlow();
```

## Build Verification

✓ built in 41.19s
```

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [x] All code changes committed to `fix/auth-session-refresh-restore` branch
- [x] Build passes without errors
- [ ] Manual testing completed (see checklist above)
- [ ] No console errors during testing
- [ ] Session persistence verified
- [ ] All role-based access working
- [ ] Logout working correctly
- [ ] Create pull request for code review
- [ ] Merge to main after approval
- [ ] Deploy to staging first
- [ ] Verify on staging
- [ ] Deploy to production

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur in production:
1. Revert commit: `git revert 07ea066`
2. Push to main
3. Redeploy
4. All changes are isolated and safe to revert

## Files Changed
