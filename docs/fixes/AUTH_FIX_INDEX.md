## 🗂️ Code Files

### Core Implementation
```
src/
├── hooks/
│   ├── useAuth.tsx         ← Updated: Deterministic auth with fail-safe
│   └── useProfile.ts       ← New: Safe profile loading
├── components/
│   └── ProtectedRoute.tsx  ← New: Role-based route protection
└── App.tsx                 ← Updated: Protected dashboard routes
```

### Database Migration

## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

### Before ❌
- Infinite loading spinners on some devices
- Session loss on page refresh
- Unreliable authentication state
- No role-based route protection
- Poor error handling

### After ✅
- **Maximum 2-second loading** (guaranteed)
- **Reliable session persistence** (refresh, restart, offline)
- **Deterministic auth state** (no race conditions)
- **Role-based protection** (admin, cleaner, customer)
- **Graceful error handling** (never crashes)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (For the Impatient)

### 1. Deploy in 3 Commands
```bash
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor
<copy AUTH_SESSION_REFRESH_FIX_MIGRATION.sql>

# Deploy frontend
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement deterministic auth restoration"
git push origin main

# Verify in browser console
<copy verify_auth_fix.js>
```

### 2. Test in 2 Minutes
1. Login to your site
2. Refresh page (F5) - should stay logged in
3. Close browser, reopen - should stay logged in
4. ✅ Done!

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Quick tests to verify everything works:

```bash
□ Login with email/password
□ Refresh page - still logged in
□ Close browser, reopen - still logged in
□ Try admin dashboard as customer - denied
□ Try customer dashboard as customer - allowed
□ Loading spinner < 2 seconds
□ No console errors
□ Run verify_auth_fix.js - passes
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Infinite Loading
```javascript
// Fix: Clear storage
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

### Issue 2: Session Lost on Refresh
```sql
-- Fix: Verify migration ran
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles;
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'profiles';
```

### Issue 3: Access Denied Errors
```sql
-- Fix: Check user role
SELECT * FROM user_roles WHERE user_id = '<user-id>';
-- Assign role if needed
UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE id = '<user-id>';
```
