# Payment View Fix Summary

## Problem
The admin dashboard payment table was showing "N/A" for most columns (Booking Reference, Customer, Service, Provider, Paid At) because the payment data was being fetched without the necessary joins to the bookings and services tables.

## Root Cause
In `src/pages/dashboard/AdminDashboard.tsx`, the payments query was only selecting basic payment fields:
```typescript
.select('id, amount, status, created_at')
```

This meant the `payment.bookings` object was null, causing the AdminPaymentsTable component to display "N/A" for all booking-related fields.

## Solution
Updated the payment query to include proper joins to bookings and services tables:

```typescript
// Before (line 115-118)
const { data: paymentsData, error: paymentsError } = await supabase
  .from('payments')
  .select('id, amount, status, created_at')
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false });

// After
const { data: paymentsData, error: paymentsError } = await supabase
  .from('payments')
  .select(`
    *,
    bookings!booking_id (
      *,
      services (*)
    )
  `)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Updated Query Structure**: Changed from selecting only basic fields to selecting all payment fields with joined booking and service data
2. **Fixed Join Syntax**: Used `bookings!booking_id` to properly reference the foreign key relationship
3. **Added Debugging**: Added console logging to help troubleshoot data structure issues
4. **Generated Types**: Created proper TypeScript types for the database schema

## Files Modified
- `src/pages/dashboard/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Fixed payment query with proper joins
- `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` - Added proper TypeScript types

## Expected Result
The payment table should now display:
- ✅ Payment Reference (truncated)
- ✅ Booking Reference (from joined booking data)
- ✅ Customer Email (from joined booking data)
- ✅ Service Name (from joined service data)
- ✅ Amount (already working)
- ✅ Provider (should show "paystack" instead of "N/A")
- ✅ Status (already working)
- ✅ Paid At (should show actual payment date instead of "-")

## Additional Considerations
- RLS policies may need to be verified to ensure admin users can access the joined data
- The `is_admin` function should be working properly for RLS policy evaluation
- If issues persist, check browser console for any RLS or query errors
